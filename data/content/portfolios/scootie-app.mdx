# The Summary Report

## Top Trends

1. Facebook ad is attractive but branding is confusing for users
2. There is a lack of messaging on what the company is on Facebook, 
App Store and on webpage
3. No information on pricing on Facebook ad and App Store
4. Gamification and rewards are really seductive for everybody
5. Winning Rewards is compelling but also makes user feel 
suspicious by its simplicity, lack of giving trust to the user
6. Task list type of rewarding system is adorable for users
7. Gifts should be interchangeable for different tastes
8. Social sign-up is definitely more preferable by users
9. Asking for personal information from a user without giving any 
information on what the app is causes frustration on users
10. Joining to a community and membership is likeable for users
11. Partners might not be known for everybody especially when they
 are not interested in the gift
12. The main value proposition of the company stays in the shadow 
of the rewarding system


# Long-term Goal Reflection

In two years Ooup will be the most preferred and convenient 
transportation method in Europe 

Task-based rewarding system is very compelling for users which 
is a competitive advantage over existing scooter rental companies.
 But the messaging on what the business is about should be clearly 
 identified. Starting from the first interaction point, users should 
 have a common perception of what Ooup is. The app can be perceived 
 as an free gift collecting system. The relationship between the brand 
 and the reward system seems a little broken. Rewards should be given 
 to sharing personal experience with Ooup Scooter Rentals. The advantage 
 of renting a scooter should be emphasized in the branding messages. 
 Marketing campaigns should be organised in various locations, 
 especially in cities which are suffering from traffic jam, and 
 also with suitable weather conditions for riding a scooter.

## Sprint Questions and Answers


<Components.STable
    header={["Sprint Questions", "Answers"]}
    rows={[
        {columns: ["Can we convince our customers that renting a scooter is the most convenient way of transportation?", 
        "Yes (depending on location), It is the easiest way to get somewhere especially you are struggling with traffic jam. But if the distance is far or the weather conditions are not suitable, riding a scooter is challenging"
        ]},
        {columns: ["Can we find a way to increase the revenue?", 
        "Yes, with the rewarding system, the number of users will increase and it will increase more with the social media marketing. Community events and sharing personal experiences with increase interest." 
        ]},
        {columns: ["Can we ensure that users can find a scooter nearby?",
        "Yes, drop-offs and charging battery are encouraged by rewarding system. The busiest stations can be predicted as the usage data is gathered, so the number of scooters and locations of stations can be arranged depending on this."
        ]}
    ]} />

## 3 Recommended Next Steps

1. Give more information on Ooup on Facebook ad and App Store. Build a common understanding of Ooup as a brand for users.
2. Include Social Sign-up and sign-in to the app
3. Reward sharing personal experiences with Ooup on social media

## Detailed Prototype feedback

- Give more information on company on every channel (Facebook ad, App store)
- Prepare a landing page and give structured information on How to rent a scooter and how to win prizes with the product usage
- Create a pricing section on landing page
- Give some endorsements from system users on the landing page
- Build a chatbot on landing page for interactive customer support
- Analyze the usage data and locate station to the most appropriate locations depending on user IP
- Expand the fleet according to demand
- Activate community events and build an user engagement based on tracking new events
- Build customized reward system, with more options for different tastes
- Build a wider partnership network
- Depending on the seasonality of the demand, prepare marketing campaigns

Rewarding system is compelling for users 
but the marketing message should be carefully selected. 
The tasks and rewards should be selected in a way that they donâ€™t 
cast a shadow on the product.
