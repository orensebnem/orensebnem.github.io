# Background

[Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/) is full of job opportunities 
for any level of positions. Our corporate customers complain for not 
reaching our right applicants for entry level positions

The new graduates are pretty overwhelmed 
and frustrated with being inexperienced 
in job seeking.

__What new grads need is more than a jobs directory.__
Our customised solution for Students will provide a full support to the new graduates in their job seeking journey

# Business Case

## Initial Focus

* 4 millions of graduates every year only in the U.S. (Source: [Statista](https://statista.com))
* 3.4 millions of entry level positions in the U.S.  (Source: [Statista](https://statista.com))
* Recruiters suffer from finding the right candidate for the jobs
* The destructive effect of outstanding student loan debt on economics (around $1.6 Trillion) (Source: [Forbes](https://forbes.com))

__College students need professional help in their job search__
* A guide to tell them what they are able to do 
* A trainer to teach them how to present their skills

## Development Costs
6 months of Development x 10K x 15 MVP features = $ 900 K 

## Revenue
Acc to  the Pew Research Center 2018 Social Media Use study 
__50% of college graduates__ in the US has a Linkedin account. 
From Linkedin statistics, __39% of Linkedin users are paid customers.__ 
(source: [kinsta.com](https://kinsta.com))

With a similar approach, __if 40%__ of this amount subscribes to 
LinkedIn Student Premium service.
Number of graduates in US : 3.9 million
Projected price of Premium Student membership: $ 9.90

($9.90 per month) x (12 months) x 3.9 million x 50% x 40%  
= $ 92 million per year  
= __$ 0.092 billion per year__
