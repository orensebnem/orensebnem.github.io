# Morning Rush for Coffee

<Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid columns={[1, null, 2]} spacing='40px'>

    <Components.Chakra.Box>
        Melbourne is a place where coffee culture is extraordinarily important. Most of the working people from different industries  waste  much  of their break time waiting in line every day both for the morning or afternoon coffee.
        This need is observed especially in the Melbourne CBD  which is  full of hidden coffee gems easily spotted by the long lines in front them.
        Working people usually have a busy schedule and suffer from long waiting time for coffee.  The solution to overcome this pain by skipping the queue, might help them enjoy their mornings better.

<Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid columns={[1, null, 2]} spacing='40px'>

    <Components.Chakra.Box>
        In order to get honest insight, interviews were held with people waiting in the line of the famous coffee shops in Melbourne CBD.

        The respondents  were asked about their coffee routines and their familiarity with food ordering apps.

        To prove and generalise findings, a survey was held with 30 working people with different drinking habits.

# Design
## Concepts & Sketching
Findings are grouped and categorised in order to generate the features for the app. With the contribution of technical experts we evaluated and prioritised in terms of value for the product and the effort needed to implement the feature.
After determining the features, the user journey was drawn in order to picture the experience on the product. Wireframes were prepared for the first round of user testing.

# Test
## Validation, Usability, Feedback

__Iteration 1__ is testing with __5 users__ who are tech-savvy and users of e-commerce tools and food ordering apps. The findings are:
Customer reviews didn’t take any interest
Testers were confused with the last order section. The last ordered drink and the coffee shop name was mixed
How daily offer was shown confused testers, they got frustrated with the whole screen
They expected to see the coffee shops listed after drink category was selected

# Test
## Validation, Usability, Feedback

__Iteration 3__ was tested with __10 testers__ on Lookback. The feedbacks are as below:
- All the testers were able to complete the task of ordering a coffee from the closest coffee shop.
- Nice to see the last purchase on the homepage
- Should have a back button to homepage after completing order, felt the frustration on users on this page
- Better to have sorting in terms of price, popularity on the coffee shop listings page
- Chips on Coffee Shop Screen are good to indicate coffee shop features
- “1-click to buy” button to skip confirmation page

Some improvement opportunities on order completion was observed. Under these considerations 1-Click to Buy Button was added.

# Solution & Impact Overview

<Components.Chakra.SimpleGrid columns={[1, null, 2]} spacing='40px'>

<Components.Chakra.Box>
With the initial solution, it was tried to introduce a solution
which basically relies on product selection and then pointing the
customer to the coffee shops nearby which serve that product.
A journey basically found in like an e-commerce app, which asks
customer what s/he is looking for “list me the blue shirts you have”.
However, user testing showed that people have a common sense to see
the coffee shops first and then make their selection from the
available products in there.

This might be a difference in experiences between a food ordering app,
and a retail e-commerce app. Therefore, every feature on a shop is shown
on listing and coffee shop screen, like the shop features and menu.
