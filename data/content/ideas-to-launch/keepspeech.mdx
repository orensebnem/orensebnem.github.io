    It was a challenge, but we made it happen ðŸ˜Š Google Meet is now integrated into Keepspeech (https://keepspeech.com)

    With this, we now officially support Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.

    One step closer to making meetings smarter, no matter the platform. ðŸ’ª

## âš¡ Jul 8, 2025  Managing Third Party Risks

<Components.Chakra.Box>
    Today we resolved an integration error caused by a recent change on <b>Zoom</b>â€™s side which
    temporarily disrupted the core product feature. After identifying the root cause,
    we adjusted our implementation and deployed the fix immediately to production.

    This was not the first time we experienced a disruption due to third party changes.
    A similar issue occurred in February 2025, which took nearly five hours to identify and fix.
    These recurring incidents have made it clear that <b>integration risks are a core business weakness for KeepSpeech.</b>

    Since we rely on third party platforms like Zoom, we often have no visibility into their deployment timelines
    or upcoming changes.

    This lack of control introduces a risk to our <b>service reliability and SLA commitments</b>,
    which could impact user trust and product reputation if not resolved quickly.
    We are actively exploring mitigation strategies to improve resilience, such as automated monitoring,
    fallback mechanisms, and direct communication with platform providers when possible.
